**Abstract**

Many real-world natural and social systems can be modeled as complex networks. As random
failures and malicious attacks can seriously destroy the structure of complex networks, it is critical to
ensure their robustness and maintain the functions. Generally, connectivity and controllability robustness
are adopted to evaluate the performance of networked systems against external attacks and/or failures.
A sequence of values is measured to dynamically indicate the network robustness with iterative node- or
edge-removal. Calculating the robustness of large-scale real-world networks is usually time consuming,
whereas deep-learning provides an efficient methodology to estimate network robustness performance.
In this paper, a multi-convolutional neural network (CNN) method called Real-RP is designed to predict the
robustness of real-world complex networks. Unknown real-world networks are first classified into known
network categories, and their robustness performance is then predicted based on the knowledge of the
specific network category trained using a substantial number of synthetic networks. Experimental results
show that: 1) real-world complex networks can be classified by a CNN with high precision, and 2) the
robustness performance of real-world networks can be predicted with lower average errors compared to
existing methods
