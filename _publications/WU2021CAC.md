**Abstract**

Connectivity robustness reflects the ability of a 
complex network maintaining its basic connected structures and 
functions under various external attacks. Conventionally, 
connectivity robustness is evaluated by simulating attacks,
which may take expensive computational resources, especially 
for large-scale networked systems. Past studies have shown that
convolution neural networks (CNN) have excellent performance 
in both regression and classification. Complex networks are 
transformed into grey images and processed by CNNs. In this 
paper, a multi-CNN framework is come out to predict the 
connectivity robustness, where each CNN performs either 
network classification or robustness prediction. Experimental 
studies are carried on four network topologies under random 
and targeted attacks. The simulations results shows that the 
proposed multi-CNN approach can precisely predict the 
connectivity robustness of complex networks. Further 
experiments also shows that multi-CNN performs better than 
single CNN method.
