**Abstract**
Network robustness is critical for various societal
and industrial networks against malicious attacks. In particular, connectivity robustness and controllability robustness reflect
how well a networked system can maintain its connectedness
and controllability against destructive attacks, which can be
quantified by a sequence of values that record the remaining
connectivity and controllability of the network after a sequence
of node- or edge-removal attacks. Traditionally, robustness is
determined by attack simulations, which are computationally
very time-consuming or even practically infeasible for largescale networks. In this article, an improved method for network
robustness prediction is developed based on learning feature representation using the convolutional neural network (LFR-CNN).
In this scheme, the higher-dimensional network data are compressed into lower-dimensional representations, which are then
passed to a convolutional neural network to perform robustness prediction. Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic
and real-world networks, both directed and undirected, demonstrate that: 1) the proposed LFR-CNN performs better than
other two state-of-the-art prediction methods, with significantly
smaller prediction errors; 2) LFR-CNN is insensitive to the variation of the input network size, which significantly extends its
applicability; 3) although LFR-CNN needs more time to perform feature learning, it can achieve accurate prediction faster
than attack simulations; and 4) LFR-CNN not only accurately predicts the network robustness, but also provides a good indicator for connectivity robustness, better than the classical spectral
measures.
