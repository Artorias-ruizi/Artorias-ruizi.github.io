**Abstract**

To quantitatively measure the connectedness
robustness of a complex network, a sequence of values that
record the remaining connectedness of the network after a
sequence of node- or edge-removal attacks can be used. However,
it is computationally time-consuming to measure the network
connectedness robustness by attack simulations for large-scale
networked systems. In the present paper, an efficient method
based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to
train for estimating the network connectedness robustness. The
new approach is motivated by the facts that 1) the adjacency
matrix of a network can be converted to a gray-scale image and
CNN is very powerful for image processing, and 2) CNN has
proved very effective in predicting the controllability robustness
of complex networks. Extensive experimental studies on directed
and undirected, as well as synthetic and real-world networks
suggest that: 1) the proposed CNN-based methodology performs
excellently in the prediction of the connectedness robustness of
complex networks as a process; 2) it performs fairly well as the
indicator for the connectedness robustness, compared to other
predictive measures.
